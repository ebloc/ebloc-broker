Welcome to eBlocBroker's documentation!
================================================
Recently, peer-to-peer based blockchain infrastructures have emerged as
disruptive technologies and have lead to the realization of crypto-currencies
and smart contracts that can used in a globally trustless manner. The Ethereum
eBlocBroker is a blockchain based autonomous computational resource broker.

The service is completely trustless, meaning that the entire broke service
operates as smart contracts on the Ethereum private blockchain, with no
priviledged access given to any party.

Code can be viewed on the `github repository`_.

If you are a smart contract developer and would like to start submitting
jobs now then check out the :doc:`./quickstart`.
